Archives Files From Discord

## Build Instructions:

Run <code>npm install</code> and <code>npx tsc</code> in the root directory.

## Run instructions:

If you want to run the bot, create a config.json file in the src directory before building. This file should be a json object with a key named <code>token</code> and its value will be the token of your discord bot. Follow the steps on the discord developer portal to find out how to get your bot's token.

After all that, run <code>npm install</code>, then <code>npx tsc</code> and then run <code>npm start</code> in the root directory to run the bot.
